# Taskify

**Taskify** is a simple task management web app built with **TypeScript**. It can:

- Easily add tasks to your to-do list
- Check tasks off when you're done
- Keep track of all your tasks in a straightforward list
- Tasks pop up immediately as you add them
- Click the checkboxes to mark tasks as complete

### Seriously, is there anything more satisfying than seeing that check mark and a strikethrough on a task?

## Happy taskifying! ðŸŽ‰
